title: 2019 - Institutional Adoption Grows
---

## Overview

The year 2019 marked a definitive pivot in the blockchain narrative. While 2018 was characterized by the "Crypto Winter" and the collapse of the ICO bubble, 2019 saw the technology being embraced by global superpowers and Fortune 500 companies. This year moved blockchain away from the fringes of experimental finance and into the boardrooms of central banks and multinational corporations. The focus shifted toward **institutional-grade infrastructure**, regulatory compliance, and the strategic importance of blockchain in global trade and national security.

## Key Developments

* **Amazon Managed Blockchain Launch:** In April 2019, AWS made blockchain "as-a-service" accessible to the masses, allowing enterprises to scale Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum networks without managing underlying hardware.
* **Ethereum’s Transaction Milestone:** Demonstrating its growing utility for decentralized applications (dApps), the Ethereum network consistently exceeded **1 million transactions per day** throughout the year.
* **Facebook Unveils Libra:** In June, Facebook (now Meta) announced **Libra**, a global digital currency. This single announcement forced global regulators to prioritize cryptocurrency legislation and accelerated the race for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs).
* **China’s State Mandate:** In October, President Xi Jinping officially declared that China should take a leading role in blockchain technology, sparking a massive wave of state-backed blockchain investment and development.
* **Bakkt Institutional Bitcoin Futures:** The launch of Bakkt, operated by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), provided a regulated, physically-settled futures market for Bitcoin, specifically designed for institutional investors.

## Important Papers

### 📄 The Libra Blockchain Whitepaper

**Summary:**
Released by the Libra Association (led by Facebook), this whitepaper proposed a global financial infrastructure built on a new blockchain designed for scalability and security. The Libra currency was intended to be a stablecoin backed by a reserve of low-volatility assets, such as bank deposits and government securities.

Technically, the paper introduced the **Move programming language**, a resource-oriented language designed to prevent common smart contract vulnerabilities like "re-entrancy" attacks. Move treats digital assets as first-class citizens that cannot be copied or discarded, only moved. The Libra blockchain utilized a BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerant) consensus mechanism, aiming to support billions of users.

Historically, this paper is significant because it was the first time a "Big Tech" giant attempted to create a private global currency. It triggered an immediate and fierce reaction from the G7 and US Congress, eventually leading to the project's rebranding as Diem and its ultimate liquidation. However, the Move language survives as a cornerstone of modern high-performance blockchains like Aptos and Sui.

### 📄 G7 Report: Investigating the Impact of Global Stablecoins

**Summary:**
Published in October 2019 by a G7 task force in coordination with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), this report was the formal global response to the Libra announcement. It serves as the regulatory foundation for how stablecoins are treated today.

The report identifies the systemic risks posed by "global stablecoins" (GSCs), including threats to monetary sovereignty, financial stability, and international anti-money laundering (AML) efforts. It famously stated that "no global stablecoin project should begin operation until the legal, regulatory and oversight challenges and risks are adequately addressed."

For your archive, this document represents the moment blockchain became a "Tier 1" geopolitical issue. It forced the conversation away from "is crypto a scam?" to "how do we regulate a technology that could replace the US Dollar?" This paper directly accelerated the development of the Digital Yuan, Digital Euro, and the eventual MiCA regulations in Europe.

### 📄 Deloitte’s 2019 Global Blockchain Survey

**Summary:**
Deloitte’s 2019 survey, "Blockchain Gets Down to Business," provided empirical evidence of the shift in corporate sentiment. Surveying over 1,300 executives across 12 countries, the report found that 53% of respondents viewed blockchain as a top-five strategic priority—a significant jump from the year prior.

The paper breaks down adoption by sector, noting that while FinTech remained the leader, sectors like life sciences and media were rapidly adopting the tech for data integrity and royalty management. It also identified the rise of "tokenization" as a primary interest for legacy firms, moving beyond simple payments to the digital representation of real-world assets like real estate and gold. This survey remains a vital historical marker of when the C-suite stopped viewing blockchain as a fad and started viewing it as a necessary evolution of enterprise IT.

## Historical Context

2019 was a year of geopolitical tension, defined by the US-China trade war. Within this context, blockchain was framed as a strategic asset. China's announcement was not just about technology; it was about financial independence from the Western-led SWIFT system. Meanwhile, in the West, the "Blockchain, not Bitcoin" mantra was popular among banks like JP Morgan, who launched **JPM Coin** for internal settlements, attempting to separate the efficiency of the ledger from the volatility of public assets.

## Connection to Modern Blockchain

The legacies of 2019 are found in:

1. **The Move Ecosystem:** The programming language born from the Libra project is now a major pillar of high-throughput Layer 1 blockchains.
2. **The CBDC Race:** Today's trials of the Digital Dollar and Euro are direct consequences of the "Libra shock" and China's 2019 pivot.
3. **Enterprise Web3:** The "Managed Blockchain" model pioneered by AWS in 2019 is the direct ancestor of modern "AppChains" and private enterprise subnets used by institutions like Goldman Sachs today.
