# 1985: The Ideological Foundation for Decentralization

While the technical primitives of blockchain—like hashes and public-key cryptography—were being refined in the 1980s, the year 1985 provided the movement with its most critical non-technical component: a philosophy of radical transparency and permissionless collaboration. By founding the Free Software Foundation (FSF), Richard Stallman codified the idea that software should not be a "black box" controlled by a central authority.

## Overview
1985 marks the formal beginning of the Free Software Movement. This year matters for blockchain history because it established the "Copyleft" legal framework and the "GPL" ethos. Without the precedent of shared, open-source code that anyone can audit, modify, and run, the trustless nature of modern blockchain protocols would not be possible. The transition from proprietary "siloed" software to the collaborative "GNU" model provided the social blueprint for decentralized networks.

## Key Developments

* **Formation of the FSF:** On October 4, 1985, Richard Stallman incorporated the Free Software Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to promoting the right to study, change, and distribute software.
* **The GNU Manifesto:** Published in the March 1985 issue of *Dr. Dobb's Journal*, this document laid out the moral and technical case for a completely free operating system (GNU).
* **The Concept of Copyleft:** Stallman popularized the term "Copyleft" (credited to a letter from Don Hopkins), using copyright law to ensure that software remains free for all future users rather than being restricted.
* **Early GNU Progress:** By 1985, the project had completed essential components like the GNU Emacs editor and the GNU C Compiler (GCC), proving that community-driven software could compete with proprietary giants.

## Important Papers

### 📄 The GNU Manifesto
**Author:** Richard Stallman  
**Date:** March 1985  

The GNU Manifesto is the "Declaration of Independence" for the open-source world. In it, Stallman argues that the proprietary software model is antisocial because it prevents users from helping one another. He describes his plan to build "GNU" (a recursive acronym for "GNU's Not Unix"), a complete Unix-compatible operating system that would be "free as in freedom." 

The manifesto is significant because it shifts the focus from software as a commodity to software as a community resource. For the blockchain archive, this paper is essential as it defines the "Golden Rule" of computing: if you like a program, you must share it with others. This spirit of radical sharing is what eventually allowed Satoshi Nakamoto to release Bitcoin under an open-source license, ensuring that no single company could ever own the protocol.

### 📄 GNU's Bulletin, Volume 1 Number 1
**Author:** Free Software Foundation  
**Date:** February 1986 (Drafted/Founded in late 1985)

This inaugural bulletin serves as the first official report from the FSF. It documents the early organizational structure, the initial founding documents, and the specific technical goals for the GNU project. It outlines the four essential freedoms that would later define "Free Software": the freedom to run, study, redistribute, and improve the software. 

In the context of blockchain, these "Four Freedoms" are the precursor to "DeFi" and "Open Finance." Just as the FSF argued that users must control their computing, blockchain advocates argue that users must control their value and data. This document records the moment those principles were first institutionalized.

### 📄 The Early GNU Emacs General Public License
**Author:** Richard Stallman / FSF  
**Date:** 1985 (Iterated into the first GPL in 1989)

Before the "General" Public License existed, Stallman experimented with specific licenses for programs like GNU Emacs. In 1985, he began refining the "copyleft" clauses that required anyone who redistributed the software to also provide the source code and the same rights to the next person.

While the universal "GPL v1" was not published until 1989, the 1985 license for Emacs was the first practical implementation of a legal "viral" license. This ensured that software "evolved" in the public eye. For blockchain, this is the legal ancestor of the MIT and GPL licenses used by almost every major cryptocurrency today.

## Historical Context
In 1985, the computer industry was moving toward "closed" systems. AT&T had begun enforcing copyrights on Unix, and companies like Microsoft and IBM were standardizing proprietary licenses. The FSF was a reactionary movement against this centralization, asserting that "information wants to be free" at a time when the legal system was trying to lock it down.

## Connection to Modern Blockchain
* **Open Source Roots:** Every major blockchain (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) is open-source. The FSF made this the industry standard for "trustworthy" code.
* **Auditability:** The FSF's requirement for "source code availability" is the direct ancestor of "Don't Trust, Verify." 
* **Decentralized Governance:** The FSF showed that a global community of volunteers could build a complex system (an OS) without a corporate CEO, providing the template for DAOs and decentralized dev teams.
