# History of Blockchain

## About This Archive

This timeline presents the foundational papers and key developments that led to the creation of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Each entry includes:

- **Year/Date**: When the paper was published or event occurred
- **Brief Summary**: A concise introduction to help you understand the significance
- **Original Paper**: Link to the source document when available

The evolution of blockchain didn't happen overnight. It's built on decades of research in:
- **Cryptography**: From public-key encryption to hash functions
- **Distributed Systems**: Peer-to-peer networks and consensus mechanisms
- **Digital Currency**: Early attempts at creating electronic cash
- **Open Source Movement**: Community-driven development and shared knowledge

## How to Navigate

The sidebar organizes everything chronologically. Start from the beginning to see how each innovation built upon previous work, or jump to specific years that interest you.

I've written brief summaries for each paper, though I haven't had time to analyze every one in depth yet. I hope to collaborate with others soon to expand these analyses.

## The Journey Ahead

From Ralph Merkle's tree structures in 1979 to Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008, and beyond to Ethereum's smart contracts and modern Layer 2 solutions—this archive traces the intellectual lineage of one of the most transformative technologies of our time.

Let's explore together how we got here.
