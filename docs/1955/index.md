title: 1955 - SHARE, Inc. and the Birth of Open Source
---

## Overview
While the year 1955 predates the first computer network by decades, it marks a pivotal moment in the "pre-history" of blockchain: the birth of the **collaborative software model**. Before blockchain could decentralize finance, software development itself had to be decentralized. SHARE, Inc. was the world’s first enterprise-level user group, established to allow programmers to exchange code and ideas freely. This established the "Open Source" ethos that remains the bedrock of every major blockchain protocol today, from Bitcoin to Ethereum.

## Key Developments
* **Foundation of SHARE:** In August 1955, representatives from 17 installations of the IBM 704 computer met in Los Angeles to form SHARE.
* **The First "Code Repository":** Long before GitHub, SHARE acted as a physical library where members mailed in punched cards containing subroutines, which were then distributed to other members.
* **The Shift in Value:** Members realized that the true value of computing lay in the *logic* and *algorithms* rather than the hardware alone, leading to a culture of mutual benefit over proprietary secrecy.

## Important Papers

### 📄 The SHARE 704 Installation Procedures and Early Meeting Minutes
**Historical Source:** *Records of SHARE, Inc. (Archived at the Charles Babbage Institute)*

The founding documents of SHARE, Inc. represent the first formal "Consensus Rules" for a software community. In the mid-1950s, IBM provided hardware but very little software. Users were forced to write their own operating programs from scratch. The SHARE founding documents outlined a radical new agreement: if one member wrote a useful utility, they would share it with the collective to avoid "reinventing the wheel."

These early records detail the logistical challenges of sharing code in an era of punched cards. They demonstrate a proto-decentralized governance model where technical standards were decided by a committee of users rather than a single corporate entity. By analyzing these minutes, we see the birth of the "User Group" as a governing body—a direct ancestor to the Foundation models (like the Ethereum Foundation) that oversee modern blockchain ecosystems. These documents prove that the "Open Source" movement wasn't born from 1970s counter-culture, but from 1950s pragmatism.

### 📄 "The SHARE Operating System" - A Historical Analysis
**Author:** *Historical Perspective based on the work of Akera & Norberg*

This paper examines the development of the SHARE Operating System (SOS) for the IBM 709. Unlike modern OS development, SOS was a collaborative effort between multiple aerospace companies and IBM. The paper details how this collaboration was one of the first times "competitive" entities worked together on a shared technical infrastructure. 

The summary of this work highlights the friction between corporate interests and the "Common Good" of the developer community. It discusses how the lack of centralized control led to both incredible innovation and significant coordination challenges—themes that are eerily similar to modern "Forking" debates in blockchain. The paper concludes that while the SOS project was eventually overtaken by IBM’s proprietary systems, it set the precedent for the GPL (General Public License) and the decentralized development cycles we see in the 21st century.

## Historical Context
In 1955, computers were the size of rooms and cost millions of dollars. Software was not yet a "product" you could buy in a store; it was a set of instructions you had to invent yourself. In this high-stakes environment, SHARE provided a safety net. It shifted the culture from "isolated silos" to a "shared library," a move that was necessary for the survival of the nascent computing industry.

## Connection to Modern Blockchain
Blockchain is fundamentally built on **Open Source Software (OSS)**. 
1.  **Trustless Collaboration:** Just as SHARE members collaborated without needing a central vendor to provide all solutions, blockchain developers collaborate globally on public repositories.
2.  **The Common Good:** Blockchain protocols are "Public Goods." The SHARE model proved that sharing code actually increases the value of the ecosystem for everyone involved.
3.  **Governance:** The way SHARE members voted on technical standards in 1955 is a direct precursor to the "improvement proposals" (like BIPs or EIPs) used to upgrade modern blockchains.
