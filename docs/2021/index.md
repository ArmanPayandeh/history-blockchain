title: 2021 - NFT Boom & Crypto Goes Mainstream
---

## Overview

The year 2021 marked a watershed moment when blockchain technology and cryptocurrency broke into mainstream consciousness. This was the year when digital art sold for tens of millions at prestigious auction houses, when a sovereign nation adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, when a major cryptocurrency company went public on NASDAQ, and when Ethereum fundamentally redesigned its fee structure. The convergence of these events transformed the blockchain ecosystem from a niche technological experiment into a force that could no longer be ignored by traditional finance, governments, and popular culture.

What made 2021 particularly significant was not just the price appreciation of cryptocurrencies—though Bitcoin did reach an all-time high of approximately $69,000—but rather the institutional validation and real-world adoption that occurred across multiple fronts simultaneously. The NFT market exploded from relative obscurity to become a multi-billion dollar phenomenon. Major corporations began accepting crypto payments. Central banks started seriously exploring digital currencies. And the infrastructure supporting the crypto ecosystem matured dramatically, with Ethereum's London Hard Fork representing one of the most significant technical upgrades in blockchain history.

This was also a year of contradictions: unprecedented adoption alongside growing regulatory scrutiny, technological innovation alongside network congestion problems, and massive wealth creation alongside concerns about environmental impact and speculation. Understanding 2021 is essential for comprehending how blockchain moved from the periphery to the center of technological and financial discourse.

## Key Developments

### Bitcoin Reaches All-Time High

In November 2021, Bitcoin reached its then all-time high of approximately $69,000, representing a remarkable recovery from previous market cycles. This price milestone wasn't just about speculation—it reflected growing institutional adoption, with major corporations adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets and financial institutions launching crypto investment products. The rally was fueled by several factors: unprecedented monetary stimulus in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, growing institutional interest, and increasing recognition of Bitcoin as "digital gold."

The November peak came after a year of steady gains, with Bitcoin starting 2021 around $29,000 and experiencing several surges throughout the year. The cryptocurrency had successfully weathered China's mining crackdown earlier in the year and emerged stronger, with mining operations relocating to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions. This demonstrated Bitcoin's resilience and decentralization in practice, as the network continued operating smoothly despite a major geopolitical disruption affecting a significant portion of its mining capacity.

### El Salvador Adopts Bitcoin as Legal Tender

On June 9, 2021, El Salvador's Legislative Assembly passed the groundbreaking Bitcoin Law (Legislative Decree No. 57), making the country the first in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. The law went into effect on September 7, 2021. President Nayib Bukele championed the initiative, arguing it would promote financial inclusion for the approximately 70% of Salvadorans without bank accounts and reduce remittance costs from abroad.

The implementation included the launch of Chivo, a government-sponsored digital wallet, with $30 in Bitcoin provided to citizens who signed up. The government also installed Bitcoin ATMs throughout the country and required businesses to accept Bitcoin as payment (though this requirement was later modified). While the experiment drew significant international attention and sparked debates about cryptocurrency adoption at a national level, it also faced criticism from international financial institutions and generated domestic protests from citizens concerned about the cryptocurrency's volatility and the government's transparency in implementing the program.

### Coinbase IPO

On April 14, 2021, Coinbase Global, Inc. went public through a direct listing on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol "COIN," marking the first major cryptocurrency company to list on a U.S. stock exchange. The company had filed its S-1 registration statement with the SEC on February 25, 2021, which was declared effective on April 1, 2021. The direct listing opened at approximately $381 per share, valuing the company at roughly $86 billion on its first day of trading.

This was a monumental moment for the cryptocurrency industry, representing mainstream acceptance and providing traditional investors with a regulated way to gain exposure to the crypto economy. Coinbase's prospectus revealed impressive financial metrics: over $456 billion in lifetime trading volume and $90 billion in assets stored on the platform as of December 31, 2020. The IPO validated the business model of cryptocurrency exchanges and paved the way for other crypto companies to consider going public. It also subjected Coinbase to increased regulatory oversight and reporting requirements, setting precedents for how crypto companies would interface with traditional financial regulations.

### NFT Market Explosion

The NFT (Non-Fungible Token) market exploded in 2021, transforming from a niche collector's market into a mainstream phenomenon. The pinnacle of this boom was the sale of Beeple's digital artwork "Everydays: The First 5000 Days" at Christie's auction house for $69.3 million in March 2021. This sale, which was Christie's first-ever purely digital artwork auction, catapulted NFTs into mainstream consciousness and legitimized digital art in the eyes of traditional art collectors and institutions.

The Beeple sale was just the tip of the iceberg. Throughout 2021, NFT projects like CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club, and Art Blocks saw explosive growth, with some individual NFTs selling for millions of dollars. The total NFT market volume reached billions of dollars, with platforms like OpenSea, Nifty Gateway, and Rarible processing enormous transaction volumes. NFTs expanded beyond art into music, gaming, virtual real estate, and digital collectibles. Major brands, celebrities, and athletes launched their own NFT projects. However, the rapid growth also raised questions about sustainability, copyright issues, and whether the market was experiencing a speculative bubble.

### Ethereum London Hard Fork and EIP-1559

On August 5, 2021, at block 12,965,000, Ethereum implemented the London Hard Fork, which included five Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). The most significant was EIP-1559, a fundamental redesign of Ethereum's fee market mechanism. Before EIP-1559, Ethereum used a first-price auction system where users bid gas fees and miners prioritized the highest bids, leading to unpredictable and often excessive transaction costs.

EIP-1559 introduced a new transaction pricing mechanism with a base fee that adjusts automatically based on network congestion, plus an optional priority fee (tip) for faster processing. Crucially, the base fee is burned (permanently removed from circulation) rather than paid to miners. This burning mechanism introduced deflationary pressure on ETH supply during periods of high network activity. The upgrade also expanded the maximum block size, allowing for short-term bursts in capacity during peak demand. EIP-1559 made transaction fees more predictable for users and had significant implications for Ethereum's monetary policy, leading some to describe ETH as "ultrasound money" due to the potential for net-negative issuance.

## Important Papers and Documents

### 📄 El Salvador Bitcoin Law (Legislative Decree No. 57)

**Published:** June 9, 2021  
**Authors:** Government of El Salvador  
**Link:** [English translation available at FREOPP](https://freopp.org/whitepapers/el-salvadors-bitcoin-law-full-english-text/)

The Bitcoin Law passed by El Salvador's Legislative Assembly on June 9, 2021, is a concise but revolutionary legal document consisting of 16 articles that establish Bitcoin as unrestricted legal tender with liberating power. The law's stated purpose is to regulate Bitcoin for any transaction that public or private entities require, while maintaining the existing Monetary Integration Law that established the U.S. dollar as legal tender.

Key provisions include establishing that the exchange rate between Bitcoin and the U.S. dollar would be freely determined by the market, that prices may be expressed in Bitcoin, that tax contributions can be paid in Bitcoin, and that Bitcoin exchanges would not be subject to capital gains tax. Article 7 created particular controversy by stating that "every economic agent must accept Bitcoin as payment when offered," though the law included provisions for those lacking the technology to process Bitcoin transactions. The government committed to providing training mechanisms and alternatives for the population to access Bitcoin transactions.

The law required the State to guarantee automatic and instantaneous convertibility of Bitcoin to USD through a trust at El Salvador's Development Bank (BANDESAL). This trust was funded with $150 million to facilitate adoption and provide liquidity. The law gave the Central Bank and Financial Superintendency of El Salvador responsibility for regulating Bitcoin-related financial matters within their respective areas. The document took effect 90 days after publication in the official gazette, making September 7, 2021, the historic date when Bitcoin became legal tender.

While the law represented a bold experiment in cryptocurrency adoption at a national level, it also attracted significant criticism from international financial institutions including the IMF and World Bank, who raised concerns about macroeconomic stability, transparency, and the potential for facilitating money laundering. Domestic opposition also emerged, with many Salvadorans expressing concerns about the cryptocurrency's volatility and the government's handling of public funds for Bitcoin purchases. The law underwent significant changes in 2025 as part of an IMF loan agreement, removing the mandatory acceptance requirement and reducing government involvement.

### 📄 Coinbase S-1 Registration Statement

**Filed:** February 25, 2021  
**Declared Effective:** April 1, 2021  
**Link:** [SEC Filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000162828021003168/coinbaseglobalincs-1.htm)

Coinbase's S-1 registration statement, filed with the SEC in February 2021, provides comprehensive insight into the operations, finances, and risks of what was then the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States. The document is notable for being the first major cryptocurrency company to file for a public listing, and it set precedents for how crypto businesses would present themselves to traditional investors and regulators.

The prospectus revealed impressive growth metrics: Coinbase had facilitated over $456 billion in trading volume since inception and had over $90 billion in assets stored on its platform as of December 31, 2020. The company reported 43 million retail users and 7,000 institutional clients across more than 100 countries. Financially, Coinbase generated $1.3 billion in revenue in 2020, up from $534 million in 2019, demonstrating the explosive growth of the crypto market. Notably, the company was profitable, with net income of $322 million in 2020.

The filing detailed Coinbase's business model, which derives revenue primarily from transaction fees charged to users trading cryptocurrencies. The company emphasized its focus on regulatory compliance and its role as a trusted intermediary in the crypto ecosystem. The prospectus also outlined significant risk factors, including regulatory uncertainty, cryptocurrency price volatility, competition from decentralized exchanges, and dependence on continued growth in crypto adoption. The company described its mission as creating "an open financial system for the world" and positioning itself as the "Amazon of crypto assets."

The S-1 also provided insight into Coinbase's corporate governance structure, including the dual-class share structure that gave co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong and other insiders enhanced voting power. The document described plans for the direct listing rather than a traditional IPO, meaning the company wouldn't raise new capital but would allow existing shareholders to sell their shares. This approach was relatively novel and reflected confidence in existing market demand for Coinbase shares. The successful listing on April 14, 2021, at a valuation exceeding $85 billion validated not just Coinbase's business but the entire cryptocurrency industry's legitimacy in the eyes of traditional finance.

### 📄 EIP-1559: Fee Market Change for ETH 1.0 Chain

**Proposed:** April 2019  
**Implemented:** August 5, 2021 (London Hard Fork)  
**Authors:** Vitalik Buterin, Eric Conner, Rick Dudley, Matthew Slipper, Ian Norden, Abdelhamid Bakhta  
**Link:** [Official EIP Document](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559)

EIP-1559 represents one of the most significant changes to Ethereum's economic model and user experience since the network's launch. The proposal fundamentally redesigned how transaction fees work on Ethereum, addressing long-standing issues with fee volatility and user experience while introducing important changes to the network's monetary policy.

Under the previous system, Ethereum used a first-price auction mechanism where users submitted transactions with a "gas price" bid, and miners selected transactions with the highest bids for inclusion in blocks. This led to several problems: extreme fee volatility during periods of high demand, users frequently overpaying for transactions due to poor fee estimation tools, and miners having incentives to manipulate the fee market. During network congestion, users often had to guess how much to pay, leading to transactions either failing to get included or paying far more than necessary.

EIP-1559 introduced a new transaction format (Type 2 transactions) with several key components. First, there's a protocol-enforced "base fee" that varies algorithmically based on how full previous blocks were. If blocks are more than 50% full, the base fee increases; if they're less than 50% full, it decreases. This adjustment happens gradually and predictably (up to 12.5% per block), making fees more predictable for users. The base fee must be paid by every transaction in a block, and critically, this payment is burned—permanently removed from the ETH supply—rather than paid to miners.

Second, users can specify a "priority fee" (also called a "tip") that goes directly to miners and can be used to incentivize faster inclusion of transactions. Users set a maximum fee they're willing to pay (which covers both the base fee and priority fee), and any excess is refunded. This makes the system more user-friendly while still allowing for prioritization when needed. The proposal also increased the maximum block size to double the target, allowing for temporary capacity increases during demand spikes.

The burning mechanism has profound implications for Ethereum's monetary policy. During periods of high network usage, more ETH is burned through the base fee than is issued to miners through block rewards, creating deflationary pressure on ETH supply. This introduced the concept of ETH as "ultrasound money," a play on Bitcoin's "sound money" narrative, since ETH supply could actually decrease over time. After Ethereum's transition to proof-of-stake, the deflationary effect became even more pronounced since staking issuance is lower than mining issuance was.

The implementation of EIP-1559 was not without controversy. Miners initially opposed it since they would lose a significant source of revenue (the base fee that would now be burned). Some mining pools threatened to protest the change, though the upgrade ultimately proceeded smoothly. The proposal also generated extensive academic analysis, with computer scientist Tim Roughgarden publishing a detailed economic analysis examining its game-theoretic properties and potential outcomes.

Since implementation, EIP-1559 has generally succeeded in its goals of making fees more predictable and improving user experience, though it hasn't significantly reduced average fees (which was not its primary goal). The burning mechanism has removed millions of ETH from circulation, with the total varying based on network usage. The upgrade demonstrated Ethereum's ability to implement complex protocol changes and showed the community's commitment to improving the user experience even when facing opposition from economically important stakeholders.

### 📄 "An Economic Analysis of EIP-1559" by Tim Roughgarden

**Published:** 2020 (analysis conducted pre-implementation)  
**Author:** Tim Roughgarden (Stanford University)  
**Link:** [PDF available](https://timroughgarden.org/papers/eip1559.pdf)

Tim Roughgarden, a renowned computer science professor at Columbia University (previously Stanford) and expert in algorithmic game theory, conducted a comprehensive economic analysis of EIP-1559 before its implementation. This report provided crucial theoretical backing for the proposal and addressed concerns about its game-theoretic properties and potential outcomes. The paper was commissioned by the Ethereum Foundation to provide rigorous academic analysis of the proposal's mechanisms.

Roughgarden's analysis focused on several key questions: Would EIP-1559 actually improve the user experience compared to the first-price auction system? Would miners have incentives to follow the protocol honestly or would they try to manipulate it? How would the mechanism perform under different demand conditions? The paper formalized what "good user experience" means in the context of transaction fee mechanisms, defining it in terms similar to shopping on Amazon (where prices are posted and clear) versus buying a house (where prices are uncertain and strategic bidding is required).

The analysis confirmed that EIP-1559 would make transaction pricing more straightforward for users except during rapid increases in demand, where blocks might grow beyond the target size and users would need to adjust their bids. The paper examined the incentives for miners, showing that under certain conditions, miners would not benefit from including fake transactions or colluding with users to move payments off-chain. It also analyzed how the base fee adjustment mechanism would respond to changing demand, demonstrating that it would converge toward market-clearing prices.

Roughgarden acknowledged that no transaction fee mechanism can perfectly solve all problems simultaneously—there are fundamental trade-offs between different desirable properties. However, he concluded that EIP-1559 represented a significant improvement over the first-price auction system for most practical purposes, particularly in making transaction inclusion more predictable for typical users. The paper's rigorous academic analysis gave the Ethereum community confidence to proceed with the upgrade and provided a model for how complex protocol changes should be evaluated before implementation.

### 📄 Beeple's "Everydays: The First 5000 Days" - Christie's Auction Documentation

**Auction Date:** March 11, 2021  
**Final Price:** $69,346,250  
**Auction House:** Christie's  
**Link:** Information available at Christie's and various news sources

While not a traditional academic paper, the Christie's auction of Beeple's "Everydays: The First 5000 Days" represents a pivotal moment in blockchain history and digital art. The sale generated extensive documentation, analysis, and commentary that collectively illustrate the NFT phenomenon of 2021. The artwork itself is a collage of 5,000 individual images that artist Mike Winkelmann (known as Beeple) created daily over 13 years starting May 1, 2007.

The auction was groundbreaking in multiple ways. It was Christie's first purely digital artwork sale, marking mainstream art world acceptance of NFT art. The auction attracted 33 bidders and drew 22 million visitors to Christie's website during the final minutes. The winning bidder was Vignesh Sundaresan (known as MetaKovan), a cryptocurrency investor who paid using 42,329 Ether. The sale catapulted Beeple to become the third most valuable living artist by auction price, behind only Jeff Koons and David Hockney.

Christie's detailed prospectus for the auction explained how the NFT, generated by MakersPlace, was encrypted with the artist's signature and verified on a blockchain, establishing provable digital ownership and authenticity. This was revolutionary because digital art had previously been difficult to monetize due to its infinite reproducibility. The NFT provided a solution by creating verifiable scarcity for digital items. The auction also marked Christie's first acceptance of cryptocurrency as payment, further cementing the intersection of traditional art markets with blockchain technology.

The sale generated enormous media coverage and public fascination, introducing millions of people to the concept of NFTs. Art critics, technologists, and economists all weighed in on what the sale meant for art, value, and ownership in the digital age. Some saw it as a legitimate evolution of art markets, while skeptics compared it to historical speculative manias like tulip mania. Regardless of perspective, the Beeple sale undeniably brought NFTs into mainstream consciousness and sparked a wave of NFT projects, celebrity endorsements, and institutional interest in digital collectibles.

Subsequent analysis revealed complexity in the sale's narrative. The buyer had connections to a tokenization project related to Beeple's work, raising questions about conflicts of interest and whether the sale was partly a marketing exercise. This didn't diminish the historical significance but did add nuance to understanding the economics and motivations behind such high-profile NFT transactions. The Beeple sale remains a definitive moment in understanding 2021's NFT boom and the complex intersection of art, technology, and speculation.

## Historical Context

To understand 2021's significance, it's essential to consider the preceding years. The 2017-2018 crypto bubble had introduced mainstream audiences to Bitcoin and ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings), but the subsequent crash left many declaring cryptocurrency a failed experiment. Ethereum had launched in 2015 and slowly built an ecosystem of decentralized applications, but scalability issues and high fees limited adoption. NFTs had existed in niche forms since at least 2017 (with projects like CryptoKitties), but hadn't achieved widespread recognition or significant value.

The COVID-19 pandemic beginning in 2020 changed everything. Unprecedented monetary stimulus, near-zero interest rates, and a shift to digital-first living created conditions favorable to cryptocurrency adoption. People stuck at home during lockdowns explored new technologies and investment opportunities. The traditional financial system showed its limitations, with bank closures and difficulties accessing services, while Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies continued operating without interruption. Institutional investors, seeking returns in a low-rate environment and hedge against potential inflation, began viewing cryptocurrency more seriously.

DeFi (Decentralized Finance) emerged as a major force in 2020, demonstrating that blockchain could support complex financial applications beyond simple value transfer. This laid groundwork for 2021's expansion into NFTs, gaming, and other applications. Ethereum's ecosystem matured significantly, with layer-2 scaling solutions beginning to address the network's capacity limitations. The stage was set for mainstream adoption.

Against this backdrop, 2021's developments represented not isolated events but a convergence of technological maturity, economic conditions, and cultural readiness. When a major auction house validated digital art, when a nation state adopted Bitcoin, when a crypto company successfully listed on NASDAQ—these weren't just milestones, they were signals that blockchain technology had crossed a threshold from experimental to established.

## Connection to Modern Blockchain

The developments of 2021 established patterns and precedents that continue to shape the blockchain ecosystem today. EIP-1559's fee mechanism remains a core part of Ethereum, and its success influenced other blockchain networks to implement similar improvements. The burning mechanism contributed to Ethereum's deflationary dynamics after the network transitioned to proof-of-stake, fundamentally changing how the asset is valued and understood.

El Salvador's Bitcoin experiment, despite mixed results and later modifications, opened discussions about central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and alternative monetary systems. Multiple countries studied the Salvadoran case, and while few followed with full adoption, the precedent influenced policy debates about cryptocurrency's role in national economies. The experiment highlighted both the potential and challenges of cryptocurrency adoption at scale, informing current approaches to crypto regulation and integration.

The NFT boom of 2021, while followed by a significant market correction, established digital ownership and provable scarcity as permanent concepts in the blockchain space. NFTs evolved beyond profile pictures into gaming assets, event tickets, digital identity, and proof of attendance. The infrastructure built during 2021—marketplaces, standards, custody solutions—continues supporting ongoing NFT applications. The cultural impact of NFTs making digital items valuable persists even as specific projects rise and fall.

Coinbase's IPO paved the way for other crypto companies to access public markets and regulatory scrutiny. It demonstrated that cryptocurrency businesses could operate profitably at scale and meet traditional financial disclosure requirements. The company's experience with regulatory compliance has informed how newer crypto companies approach licensing and reporting. Coinbase's success also validated the exchange business model, encouraging competition and innovation in trading infrastructure.

Perhaps most importantly, 2021 demonstrated that blockchain technology had achieved product-market fit for multiple use cases simultaneously. It wasn't just about Bitcoin as "digital gold" or Ethereum as "world computer"—it was about functional applications that people were using daily, whether trading on Coinbase, buying NFTs, using DeFi protocols, or sending cross-border payments. This established foundation makes current blockchain development possible, as builders can leverage existing infrastructure and user bases rather than creating everything from scratch.

The year also revealed ongoing challenges that remain relevant: scalability limitations, environmental concerns about proof-of-work mining, regulatory uncertainty, and questions about speculation versus genuine adoption. Modern blockchain development continues addressing these issues through layer-2 solutions, consensus mechanism improvements, clearer regulatory frameworks, and focus on sustainable use cases.
